## Technology used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Project Goals

- To practice basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills as part of interview prep.
- Experiment with a couple methods for centering divs.
- Create an interactive add counter function to demonstrate how closure effects multiple elements created with the same code.

## Lessons learned/ problems encountered

- I'd been working previously with Bootstrap and was curious to see how easy it was to implement a fully centered div using calc and padding. See commented css for this solution. While an interesting excercise and not that complicated, it was still much more complicated than just using flexbox.
